      Hi there! My name is Jack and I am a second year computer science student at University of Rochester. I am currently studying early childhood development as a research assistant at UR Medical Center, and will be working on trade and settlement flow at Credit Suisse as a Summer Technology Analyst this upcoming summer in New York City. Within tech, I am most interested in web development and data analysis. I previously redesigned the website for After Hours, an on campus student organization, using React and have helped write Flutter tutorials for uRochesterâ€™s Google Developer Students Club.
<br></br><br></br>
Outside of school and work, I spend most of my time outdoors, either working on my golf game, hiking, or practicing photography. I also enjoy playing guitar and am a diehard Golden State Warriors fan
